# Checklist for Northcoders News - Front End

UX

- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Items aligned
  - Topics drop down off center...
- [ ] Content legible (not too wide, obstructed, etc)
- [ ] Refreshing doesnâ€™t cause an issue on sub-pages
  - getting a few errors in the console when I click around to get a topic, article, comments, post an incorect article/comment etc...

## Functionality
  - feels strange having the hover over the number of votes, when clicking it does nothing
- [ ] Users page

  - on `/articles/:topic` the article container looks very strange!

## Error Handling

- [ ] Error pages
- [ ] All errors handled
  - [ ] Navigation: (Bad topic slug in url /Bad username in url)

## Code

    * Articles component is MASSIVE. could this be split up a bit? e.g. separate articlesList component

- [ ] prop-types
  - use prop-types!

  - _Comments & Delete Comment_ Should not need to fetchComments() again after delete, we could filter the comments in state to not include the deleted one

STUDENTS SHOULD MAKE SURE ALL TESTS ARE STILL PASSING IN BACK END

## EXTRA STUFF IF YOU HAVE TIME

- [ ] Add integration tests with `cypress`
- [ ] Make sure any code that can be extracted from components is extracted and tested with `Jest`
- [ ] Add logged in user to session / local storage
- [ ] Use `aXe` extension to check for a11y issues
- [ ] Use Context API for sharing logged in user amongst components
- [ ] Add sorting functionality (make sure sort is not in render though)
- [ ] Add search functionality
